# Magic-Ride
Application to give good experience to visitors with local guides
Magic Rides

A hackathon team project, developed in 24 hours, from the idea to the presentation of the final product. The theme we received was the song from the film Alladin - A Whole New World, and consists of a travel web app, which offers customers the possibility to live real experiences with people from the city that they want to visit. The application is intended to find guides (ordinary citizens living in the city), based on a series of tags indicated by the client, making a match between the client tags and the guide's own tags, providing a unique visitation experience.
